Requirements
============
 
Midge has been developed and tested with the following software
(earlier versions may work):

   postgres-7.4.2
   psycopg-1.1.11
   python-2.3.3
   egenix-mx-base-2.0.4


Install
=======


 1) Adjust setup.py as required.

 2) Build:

      python setup.py build

 3) Install:

      sudo python set.py install

 4) Edit configuration file:

     vi /etc/midge.conf

 5) Setup the databases (one for real, one for testing)

     sudo midge-admin setup

 6) Test:

     midge-test

 7) Start:

     midged &

    (as an ordinary user)

 8) Point your browser to http://localhost:8000
    (or as per config file).


Importing/exporting bugs
========================

There are two commands:

   midge-import <users_filename> <bugs_filename> <comments_filename>

and

   midge-export <users_filename> <bugs_filename> <comments_filename>

This uses 3 csv files to store the complete state of the bug database.

The easiest way of finding out the format is to start midge, enter a
few bugs, and run midge-export...


Logging
=======

Logging information is sent to the syslog daemon (port 514) on
localhost under the LOG_USER facility. Note that you will need to have
UDP logging switched on, typically by passing "-r" to syslogd.

More verbose logging may be switched on by setting "debugging: yes" in
the Server section of /etc/midge.conf.

States
======

Approach:

  - Keep the number of states to a minimum so that the user can easily
    make queries, without accidentally missing bugs.

  - Don't have state values which are rarely used (e.g. use "new"
    again, rather than "reopened")

  - Keep states as orthogonal as possible. So for example, don't have
    a resolved category which is only relevent when the status is
    closed or fixed. Also don't allow multiple "fixed in versions" as
    this clashes with the status (use separate bugs linked through
    keywords).

  - Allow some states to have values dynamically decided by the user
    (and automatically cleaned up when unused).

  - All underlying tables (and separate user-enterable fields) are
    justified by the need for searching; do not store purely
    informative data in separate tables, and avoid the user needing to
    enter them using separate fields. For example, although it is
    useful to know which machine a bug occured on, it is most unlikely
    that one would need to search on this.

status
  new		a new unread (or reopened) bug
  reviewed	acknowledged useful entry, but don't fix yet
  scheduled     ready to be fixed now
  fixed  	believed fixed (or not a bug), but to be confirmed by testing
  closed	confirmed fixed (or not a bug)

  Note that all new bugs start as new. Typically, Managers take new to
  reviewed or cancelled, and to scheduled if ready to fix; Developers
  take scheduled to fixed, tackling them in order of priority);
  Testers take fixed to closed, cancelled, or new.

*category
  Dynamically chosen by user (e.g. eDC, eDM, config, etc)

*reported in version
  Dynamically chosen by user (e.g. release_3-1, 2.8.3pre3)

priority
  A number from 1 to 5, where 5 is the most important. Note priority
  does not mean severity (and severity is indicated in the users text).

fixed in version
  Dynamically chosen by user (e.g. release_3-1, 2.8.2pre3).

tested ok in version
  Dynamically chosen by user (e.g. release_3-1, 2.8.2pre3)

keyword

  Dynamically chosen by the user, and allows bugs to be grouped
  (e.g. comms, release management). Note that this includes grouping
  duplicates (which should be closed off together). A bug can belong
  to more than one group. Note that "category" is simply a keyword in
  a separate namespace.


* items are asked on adding new bug.
