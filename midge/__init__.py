"""Midge is a bug tracking system.

Midge is a system for tracking bugs found during the commercial
development of a software product.  It is particularly suited to a
process for which the filing, managing, fixing, and testing are all
undertaken by different roles in a trusted environment.)

Midge aims to be consistent, self-explanatory, powerful enough to
efficiently manage thousands of bugs, require no administration, and
be bug-free!)
