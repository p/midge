User visible TODOs:

- add hyperlinks to other bugs listed in posted text
- fix alignment of "order triangle" under IE5
- fix email password
- description alignment is wrong in add new bug form
- list bugs button in wrong place under IE (on list bugs screen)
- make it possible to change the title of a bug (?)
- make it possible to change ones username (?)
- make keywords work
- make forms default cursor to first field
- find a way of auto expanding text boxes (e.g. comments)
- limit length of field in new state values
- description label in add bug is not valign="top" under IE5!
- bug summary views
   - #bugs moved into certain states as histogram or by date
- inform the user when their session has timed-out
- fix: timed out session, then post. The post is not passed on after relogin
- in add bug, font in fields is different from font in description

Underlying changes:

- add some explicit means of migrating (import/export)
- automatically clear unused user-set categories

- add more unittests, particularly the server.
- declare DTD
- automatically validate the pages with http://validator.w3.org/
- use style sheets (remove all <font> tags), in a separate file
- group template.py functions into classes
- consolidate status strings into Statuses object in application.py
- grep *.py TODO
- don't use global thread lock in server.py - should be session level ?
- use docutils to format comments (including hyperlinks elsewhere)
- log source address etc in server
- logs should more clearly contain who is viewing what pages etc.
- locations.py should probably contain no html (all in templates.py)

If inside HEAD:
<style type="text/css">
table {
  font-family: verdana, arial, "sans serif";
  font-size: 175%;
}
</style>

<head>
<link rel="stylesheet" type="text/css"
href="mystyle.css" />
</head>

In which case the external .css file should contain no tags
