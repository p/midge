UNDERLYING

- don't record times in daylight savings time
- make it possible to run several midges (projects) on the same box (/etc/midge.conf)
   - pass location of config file on command line?
- write io tests
- add server unittests
- automatically clear unused user-set categories
- rename to midge/src and htdocs
- declare DTD
- automatically validate the pages with http://validator.w3.org/
- group template.py functions into classes
- consolidate status strings into Statuses object in application.py
- grep *.py TODO
- locations.py should probably contain no html (all in templates.py)
- raise exceptions rather than return None in Application if not logged in
