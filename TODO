User visible TODOs:

- cannot include quotes in search fields
- cannot search title with spaces (quoting problem?)
- search by comments
- check that have not exceeded 100 characters in URL...
   - do redirect to minimise number when bookmarking
- change order of show bug - title, R/O status, comments, edit form
- check everywhere redirecting when not logged in
- provide human readable description of search criteria on results page
- spawn bug (split a bug into two identical bugs, for separate tracking)
- add hyperlinks to other bugs listed in posted text
   - map bug #123 etc all to standard format (bug:123)
- fix alignment of "order triangle"
   - use a table within a table
- fix email password
- description alignment is wrong in add new bug form
- make forms default cursor to first field (see google)
- find a way of auto expanding text boxes (e.g. comments)
- limit length of field in new state values
- description label in add bug is not valign="top" under IE5!
- bug summary views
   - #bugs moved into certain states as histogram or by date
- inform the user when their session has timed-out
- fix: timed out session, then post. The post is not passed on after relogin
- slight alignment problem in numbers and text of list bugs location

Underlying changes:

- add some explicit means of migrating (import/export)
- automatically clear unused user-set categories
- add more unittests, particularly the server.
- declare DTD
- automatically validate the pages with http://validator.w3.org/
- use style sheets (remove all <font> tags), in a separate file
- group template.py functions into classes
- consolidate status strings into Statuses object in application.py
- grep *.py TODO
- don't use global thread lock in server.py - should be session level ?
- use docutils to format comments (including hyperlinks elsewhere)
- log source address etc in server
- logs should more clearly contain who is viewing what pages etc.
- locations.py should probably contain no html (all in templates.py)
- raise exceptions rather than return None in Application is not logged in

If inside HEAD:
<style type="text/css">
table {
  font-family: verdana, arial, "sans serif";
  font-size: 175%;
}
</style>

<head>
<link rel="stylesheet" type="text/css"
href="mystyle.css" />
</head>

In which case the external .css file should contain no tags


Search:

   - provide instructions to search page
   - unquote "+"/spaces in GET parameters
   - unittests for each search type
   - produce table
      - always show the bug id first and the title last
      - add sentence summarising the search.
      - selectable columns
      - make columns orderable (default order by increasing bug id)      
   - refactor into list functionality (?)
      - don't make "status" a special case in Row class
