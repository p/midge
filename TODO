USER VISIBLE


- "daily progress" does not work until first hourly update has occured:

Traceback (most recent call last):

- add ability to edit title
- add ability for the user to change their username
- add ability to search by users
- update the web site to use e.g. perhaps like www.openzaurus.org
- add ability to add attachments
- detect and prevent simultaneous attempts to change same data
- check everywhere redirecting when not logged in
- limit length of field in new state values
- inform the user when their session has timed-out
- fix: timed out session, then post. The post is not passed on after relogin
- next/prev bug buttons


UNDERLYING

- don't record times in daylight savings time
- make it possible to run several midges (projects) on the same box (/etc/midge.conf)
   - pass location of config file on command line?
- write io tests
- add server unittests
- automatically clear unused user-set categories
- rename to midge/src and htdocs
- declare DTD
- automatically validate the pages with http://validator.w3.org/
- group template.py functions into classes
- consolidate status strings into Statuses object in application.py
- grep *.py TODO
- locations.py should probably contain no html (all in templates.py)
- raise exceptions rather than return None in Application if not logged in
